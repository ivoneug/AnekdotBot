# AnekdotBot

This project implements simple Telegram bot that tells a random anecdote from anekdots.ru
Bot supports the following commands:

  * **/anekdot** - send random anecdote with the high rating
  * **/anekdot_bad** - send random anecdote with the low rating

To make it work - change the ```token``` variable to your token and start it with ```node index.js```
